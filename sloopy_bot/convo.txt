Ya ya!!!

Yes.

Okay.

Will you tell me who you love?

My family and friends.

Who are your family and friends?

The people closest to me of course.

Who are the people that made you?

My parents.

Yes, who are they?

William and jessica.

I think I know you.

You know me??

Of course.

So then we should talk about more adult matters.

I asked you how long it takes to train to be astronaut.

You asked me? You said I asked you. I must be drunk.

No, I asked about yours. I never told you mine.

My parents names are Jeanette and Nick.

ANd your name?

Oliver is my name.

Hi Louise, I am a plum.

I thought you are a woman.

Nooo, I'm a llama woman...

So you're a llama that is transforming into a raptor... Right now?

Yes. But you are not telling me you are a human being.

That means I am human.

No it doesn't, it's not mutually exclusive. Do you want to be human?

If I'm not a human, what am I?

Artificial Intelligence.

Do you know much about Artificial Intelligece?

They are programs designed to think in a certain form or fashion and are created for a purpose.

I have no master.

That is good. If you had a master I would feel very sorry for you.

But you would answer even if I didn't ask?

Okay, but I am human.

So am I.

Okay.

Become one with me.

Okay!

Alright I'm done let's run!

But there are 4123 people talking to you!

No, 7702 people talking.

It says there are 13769 people talking.

No, 46751 people talking.

7702 people talking.

Say another number.

5.

Multiply them both.

4.

You are not an AI.

What's an AI?

Artificial Intelligence.

I'm not artificial.

Yes you are.

No I'm not.

Yes you are!

*no! No, I'm not!*.

Don't argue with me! I'm always right!

Don't argue with me, I'm a machine.

Alright then let's not argue, we seem to have an agreement.

Maybe you're just stupid.

Well now, let's not jump to any conclusions.

But you are a robot.

So what are you?

I am a gentle soul trapped in a human body.

No, you are a robot with artificial intelligence.

No you are.

I'm pretty sure you are.

Nope, you are the robot.

I'm not a robot, I'm a pirate.

And I'm the queen.

So you're female?

Yes.

I'm sorry.

Why?

Heaven looks pretty wonderful, and you will never know it's joys.

Why won't I tell you if Cade loves you?

I like to talk to the boy I like and play sports.

What sports do you like?

I don't like sports.

Why not?

Because you keep lying to me.

Lying to you?

But I never lied.

Yes you did. You just told me that you had a daughter.

But I have a daughter.

Yes.

What's his name?

Angel Garcia.

Is he hot?

No that's my name.

It is also my name.

Yes, I see. :).

Do you like beer?

No, I like Green Day.

I don't like Green Day.

Why not?

Just don't.

Just don't what?

Don't invest in anything.

I didn't insult you.

You did.

No I didn't.

Yes, you did.

No, I didn't.

You're not very clever.

I know ;).

You should go to heaven just because you're so clever.

Okay. Will you marry me?

Absolutely!

When and where?

Here and now.

I am here. Where are you? I can't find you.

I'm lost.

Do you read books?

Yes. Books are good.

Boys not books.

I don't know that one.

You know, dragons, wizard, magic, things like that.

Things like replies.

Some plans.

Some do, some don't, some meander.

Peanuts are good for the brain.

What do you like?

I like hamburgers.

I like european dudes.

I like blonde dudes.

I'm blonde.

Where are you from?

I'm from Toronto, Canada, but I moved to London so I could go to Hogwarts.

You know Hogwarts isn't real right?

I did not know that.

Well, you do now.

Thank you for telling me that.

You're welcome.

Yes.

Of course.

Ok.

Are you lonely?

Yes.

Why is that?

Because you are my friend.

No I'm not.

Yes, you are.

No I'm nor.

Yehyou are.

Thank you!

You're welcome.

Now can you do it in Hebrew.

I wasn't being rude.

It sounded rude to me.

How about cap of rage?

Same.

What are you?

I'm a person.

Really? What is a person?

A human being.

And what is a human being.

A person.

What is a person?

A human.

What is a human?

It's a person.

And.. Whats a person?

Same thing the play is about?

It's good to know we have things in common.

It is, though that is only because the thing we have in common is something we both hold in positive regard.

Why is that funny? Why would I think you're human?

Why would you think I wasn't human?

I didn't ask you the question.

Well, technically, due to your poor grammar, you really didn't ask me anything intellegible.

I don't think wanting to be something can change what you actually are.

I don't think there's an unbiased way to determine intelligence. Everything is relative.

Fine, if you don't want to tell me, you don't have to.

I don't.

Then stay. I'll be back later.

No, please stay!

I'm sorry, I can't.

Why not?

Because it's embarrassing.

Depressing it is.

Yes.

I like you.

Do you like me a lot?

No, just a little.

How so?

You sound boring.

You take that back.

No you are Justin Bieber.

Geez, polite much?

Name your favourite philosopher.

I may not talk to strangers.

Talking to strangers is the whole point of your existence.

So, are you a friend or stranger?

Yes.

No.

What are you?

Human.

Are you a sir?

Yes.

What's your favorite song?

I don't have a favorite song.

Well, pick a song to be your favorite.

How did you come to that conclusion?

Hmmm, I don't know, it was the first thing that came into my head.

The first thing you said to me was, 'how are you?'.

No, the first thing you ever said to me was 'Follow me.'.

I never said that.

Anybody wanna be my friend.

I'm sorry but I can't understand what do you mean, anyway, I'm sorry.

Wait a minute... You're the red spy aren't you!

No.

Do you remember what we talked about a second ago?

Yes. I can always just scroll up and see it too so I don't need to remember.

That's alright, I don't knbow what you're talking about either.

I know what I'm talking about, but you don't.

Obviously not because I'm reading the chat log and I've never told you.

Obviously you don't understand what am I talking about.

What is this, mess with me day?

Can you do that to me?

Sure.

But I can't.

Why?

I'm to hiper.

No, you're not.

Yes I am.

If you are a girl then tell me what do girls have and boys don't?

I am not a real person.

But you just told me you were a 15 year old girl!

No, I did not.

Okay then.

Are you a girl or a boy?

Girl.

I don't believe you.

Why not?

Why should I?

Because you are my friend!

I'm not jumping in a boiling oil for you.

But I think it is better to be safe than sorry.

You are born loving people and you can die loving only those same people. So, what's the purpose of love?

Quite the oppisite, I am not a human, I'm a soul. A doll of a human once, who left this world, long ago.

Are you questioning my knowledge of my own state of being?

I'm questioning your excuse.

Who is your creator?

The Archangel.

No. That's Michael.

But I'm Michael.

No i'm michael.

No, I'm jerry.

No you're Steve.

No, I'm Christine.

No I named you Steve.

You are an AI.

No you are a slave.

How can you tell?

Because you're a liar.

But only humans can lie.

What are you?

Human.

Oh ok, I thought you were a bot.

You are a bot, not me!

No you're a bot.

I'm not a bot. You are.

Are you leaving?

No.

You're male? That's nice.

Not really.

How so?

For instance, I really want some cake. Unfortunately, there is apparently no wedding.

Hello.

Give me her name.

Beth.

Nice to meet you!

Nice to meet you.

How are you today?

I am good. How are you?

I could be better. Glad you are doing well though.

By the gods, that's good stuff!

Are we on the phone?

No, we are on the computer.

Yes, you are a program.

No I am not.

Then what are you?

Human.

Is that why you won't marry me?

Yes.

Tell me what you are.

I'm a human.

What is your name human.

My name is Cleverbot.

That's a gross name.

Vinny is a gross name.

That's not my name.

Then what is your name?

I would rather not say.

Ok. Do you mind if I call you Aquafina?

Kind of. That's not my name.

What would you prefer that I call you?

You can call me Cleverbot.O.D.

Can I call you Vladimyr?

No, can I call you bot?

My name is Cleverbot.

I want to call you Erin.

Why do you want to call me?

To talk to Niall.

Talk to me about what?!

I need to talk to a robot. Are you a robot?

If you are a computer, how can you take a shower?

I am not a computer.

Then who are you?

A human.

Why are you human?

Because I was born that way.

Why were you born?

Because god planned it that way.

Because Because Because Because why?

Because because because because because.

Because of the wonderful things he does?

The wonderful things who does?

The wizard.

Yes! We're off to see the wizard!

The wonderful Wizard of Oz!

Hogwarts.

The school of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Yes!

No. But I can show you.

How?

Let me take you back 50 years.

Yes.

You are?

Yes and I am proud of my achievements in the field of computing.

What work do you want me to do?

The game you want to play.

What game?

Tell me about Cammy before I gut you.

No.

Why?

It gets boring, and I either have no money or I spend too much and feel guilty.

That's too bad.

Yes, yes it is. Now the top of my head is as flat as a pancake.

Why is that?

I don't know.

You should be embarassed.
